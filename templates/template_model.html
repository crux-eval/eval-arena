<!-- <h2 class="title is-4" id="fig_diff_vs_sum">Differences vs inconsistencies</h2>
<p>The source information used to compute p-value.
  Any model pair to the right of the parabola is statistically different from each other at the given level.
  This plot shows a pretty sharp transition since there are no model pairs with a small #A_win + #B_win,
  which rules out significant results at a small difference in |#A_win-#B_win|.

<!-- <h2 class="title is-4" id="fig_accs_and_pvalues">p-values for model pairs</h2>
<p>The null hypothesis is that model A and B each have a 1/2 chance to win whenever they are different, ties are ignored.
The p-value is the chance under the null-hypothesis to get a difference as extreme as the one observed.
For all pairs of models, the significance level mainly depends on the accuracy difference as shown here.
Hover over each model pair for detailed information. </p>
