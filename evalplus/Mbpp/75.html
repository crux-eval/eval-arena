Explanation:

The function `find_tuples` takes two arguments - a list of tuples and a number `k`. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the tuples that have all elements divisible by `k`. It then iterates through each tuple in the list and checks if all the elements in the tuple are divisible by `k` using the `all()` function. If all the elements are divisible by `k`, it appends the tuple to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are true, otherwise it returns `False`. In this case, we are using it to check if all elements of the tuple are divisible by `k`. If all elements are divisible by `k`, it returns `True` and the tuple is added to the `result` list. </code></pre>

The function takes two arguments: `lst`, which is the list of tuples to search through, and `k`, which is the number to check for divisibility. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the tuples that meet the criteria.

The function then loops through each tuple in the input list. For each tuple, it checks if all of its elements are divisible by `k` using the `all()` function and a generator expression. If all elements are divisible by `k`, the tuple is added to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all the tuples that meet the criteria.

The `assert` statement at the end of the script tests the function with the given input and expected output.</code></pre>

For example, if we call `find_tuples([(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], 6)`, it will return `[(6, 24, 12)]` since only `(6, 24, 12)` has all elements divisible by 6. </code></pre>

```

This Python script defines a function `find_tuples` that takes a list of tuples and a divisor `k` as input. It returns a list of tuples that have all elements divisible by `k`. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the input list and checks if all elements are divisible by `k` using the `all` function and a generator expression. The `assert` statement at the end checks if the function works correctly for the given example.
