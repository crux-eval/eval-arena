Explanation:

The function `diff_even_odd` takes a list as input and initializes two variables `even_num` and `odd_num` to `None`. It then iterates through the list and finds the first even and odd numbers in the list and assigns them to these variables. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the two numbers. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the result is always positive. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given test case `[1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]` and checks if the output is `3`. </code></pre>

      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that should solve the problem:

```python
def diff_even_odd(lst):
    even = None
    odd = None

    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0 and even is None:
            even = num

            break

    return abs(even - odd)

assert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]) == 3
```

This function iterates over the list and checks if a number is even or odd. If it's the first even or odd number found, it's stored in the `even` or `odd` variable respectively. The function continues to iterate until both an even and an odd number have been found. Then it calculates the absolute difference between the first even and odd numbers and returns this value. The `abs()` function is used to ensure the result is positive regardless of the order in which the even and odd numbers are found.</code></pre>

This function works by using Python's `next` function with a generator expression to find the first even and odd number in the list. If either of these numbers are not found, `next` will return `None`. The function then returns the difference between these two numbers, or `None` if either number was not found.

The function `diff_even_odd` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the difference of the first even and first odd number of the list. If there are no even or odd numbers in the list, the function returns `None`.

The function initializes two variables `even_num` and `odd_num` to `None`. It then iterates over the list `lst` and checks if each number is even or odd. If the number is even, it checks if `even_num` is `None`. If it is, it sets `even_num` to the current number. If `even_num` is not `None`, it returns the absolute difference between `even_num` and the current number. If the number is odd, it checks if `odd_num` is `None`. If it is, it sets `odd_num` to the current number. If `odd_num` is not `None`, it returns the absolute difference between `odd_num` and the current number. If the function reaches the end of the list without finding two numbers, it returns `None`.</code></pre>

Explanation:
The function `diff_even_odd` takes a list `lst` as input. It initializes two variables `even` and `odd` to `None`. It then iterates through each number in the list. If the number is even, it assigns it to the `even` variable and checks if the `odd` variable is not `None`. If it is not `None`, it breaks out of the loop. If the number is odd, it assigns it to the `odd` variable and checks if the `even` variable is not `None`. If it is not `None`, it breaks out of the loop. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the `even` and `odd` variables.

      <pre><code>  Here's the Python script to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list:

```python
def diff_even_odd(lst):
    even_num = None
    odd_num = None
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            if even_num is None:

        else:
            odd_num = num
            break
    return abs(even_num - odd_num)
```

Explanation:

- We initialize two variables `even_num` and `odd_num` to `None`.
- We loop through the list `lst` and check if the number is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`.
- If the number is even, we assign it to `even_num` if it's the first even number we encounter.
- If the number is odd, we assign it to `odd_num` and break out of the loop.
- We return the absolute difference between `even_num` and `odd_num`.

Example:

```python
>>> diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])
3
```

The first even number is 4 and the first odd number is 1, so the difference is 4 - 1 = 3. </code></pre>

This Python script defines a function `diff_even_odd` that takes a list of numbers as input. It iterates over the list and checks if each number is even or odd. If it finds the first even number, it stores it in the `even` variable. If it finds the first odd number, it stores it in the `odd` variable. If it finds both, it returns the difference between the first even and first odd number. If it doesn't find any even or odd number, it returns `None`. The `assert` statement at the end checks if the function works correctly for the given input.
