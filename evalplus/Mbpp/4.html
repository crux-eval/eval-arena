      <pre><code>  Here's a possible solution using the heapq module:

```python
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    heap = []
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(heap, -num)
        if len(heap) > n:

assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3) == [85, 75, 65]
```

Explanation:

We use a min-heap to keep track of the n largest numbers we've seen so far. We negate each number before pushing it onto the heap, so that we can use the built-in `heapq` module to maintain a max-heap instead of a min-heap. This is because the `heapq` module only provides a way to pop the smallest element from the heap, not the largest. We push the negation of each number onto the heap, so that the smallest element in the heap is actually the largest number we've seen so far. When we're done iterating through the list, we pop the smallest n elements from the heap and negate them again to get the n largest numbers in descending order. </code></pre>

This function uses the `heapq` module in Python, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. The `heapify` function transforms a regular list into a heap, where the smallest element gets moved to the index position 0. The `nlargest` function returns the n largest elements from the iterable specified as argument. Finally, the function returns the n largest elements in descending order.

This script defines a function `heap_queue_largest` that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n` as input. It uses the `heapq.nlargest` function from the Python standard library to find the `n` largest integers in the list, and returns them in descending order. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given example input and expected output.

      <p> wizardcoder-7b. fail_base: False, fail_plus: False </p>
      <pre><code>  Here's a possible solution using a heap queue:

```python
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    heap = []
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(heap, num)
        if len(heap) > n:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    return sorted(heap, reverse=True)
```

Explanation:

- We start by creating an empty heap queue called `heap`.
- We iterate over the input list `nums` and push each number into the heap using `heapq.heappush()`.
- If the length of the heap is greater than `n`, we pop the smallest element using `heapq.heappop()` to maintain the size of the heap at `n`.
- Finally, we return the sorted heap in descending order using `sorted(heap, reverse=True)`.

Example:

```python
>>> heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3)
[85, 75, 65]
```

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step. If the input list is very large, there are more efficient algorithms that can find the n largest elements in O(n) time. </code></pre>
