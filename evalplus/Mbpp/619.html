      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that should solve the problem:

```python
def move_num(s):
    letters = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, s))
    numbers = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, s))
    return letters + numbers

assert move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand') == 'Iloveyouthreethousand1143553000'
```

This function works by using the `filter` function to separate the string into letters and numbers. The `str.isalpha` and `str.isdigit` functions are used as the filtering criteria for letters and numbers respectively. The `join` function is then used to combine the filtered results into strings. The letters string is returned first, followed by the numbers string.</code></pre>

```python
def move_num(string):
    # Split the string into a list of characters
    char_list = list(string)
    
    # Create two empty lists to store the numbers and non-numbers
    num_list = []
    non_num_list = []
    
    # Iterate through the list of characters and separate the numbers and non-numbers
    for char in char_list:

    # Combine the non-numbers and numbers in the correct order
    result = ''.join(non_num_list) + ''.join(num_list)
    
    return result
```

The function takes a string as input and returns a new string with all the numbers moved to the end of the string. The function first splits the string into a list of characters. It then creates two empty lists to store the numbers and non-numbers. It iterates through the list of characters and separates the numbers and non-numbers into the two lists. Finally, it combines the non-numbers and numbers in the correct order and returns the result.</code></pre>

      <pre><code>  Here is the Python function that moves all the numbers to the end of the given string:

```python
def move_num(s):
    nums = []
    letters = []
    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            nums.append(char)

            letters.append(char)
    return ''.join(letters + nums)

print(move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand'))
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the string. If the character is a digit, it is added to the `nums` list. If it is a letter, it is added to the `letters` list. Finally, the function returns a string that is the concatenation of the `letters` list and the `nums` list.

The `isdigit()` function is used to check if a character is a digit. If the character is a digit, `isdigit()` returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The `join()` function is used to concatenate the elements of the `letters` and `nums` lists into a single string. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the two lists.

Explanation:
The function `move_num` takes a string `s` as input. It then initializes two empty lists `nums` and `chars`. It iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is a digit, it is added to the `nums` list. Otherwise, it is added to the `chars` list. Finally, it returns a new string that is the concatenation of the `chars` and `nums` lists.

Explanation:

- We first initialize two empty lists, `nums` and `non_nums`, to store the numbers and non-numbers respectively.
- We loop through each character in the input string using a for loop.
- If the character is a digit, we append it to the `nums` list, otherwise we append it to the `non_nums` list.
- Finally, we join the two lists and return the result as a single string.

"""
Write a function to check whether the given string is a valid email address or not.

Email addresses are composed of a local-part and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more '.' or '+'.

For example, in "alice@leetcode.com", "alice" is the local-part and "leetcode.com" is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may also contain one or more '.' or '+'.

For example, in "alice.z@leetcode.com", "alice.z" is the local-part and "leetcode.com" is the domain name.

If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local-part or between characters and the '@' sign in the email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local-part. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.

For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.

If you add a plus '+' in the local-part, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.

For example, "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com".

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list. How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

Example 1:

Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leet</code></pre>
