      <pre><code>  Here's the Python code for the function to remove all the words with length k in the given string:


```python
def remove_length(string, k):
    words = string.split()
    new_string = ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])
    return new_string
```

Explanation:

- The function takes two arguments, the string and the length k.
- The string is split into a list of words using the `split()` method.
- A new list is created using a list comprehension that only includes words whose length is not equal to k.
- The list of words is then joined back into a string using the `join()` method with a space as the separator.
- The new string is returned.


We can test the function with the given example:

```python
assert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'
```

This will return `True` since the word `tet` has length 3 and is removed from the string. </code></pre>

      <p> mistral-large-latest. fail_base: False, fail_plus: False </p>
      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that should solve the problem:

```python
def remove_length(s, k):
    return ' '.join(word for word in s.split() if len(word) != k)

assert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'
```

This function works by splitting the input string `s` into a list of words, then using a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the words whose length is not equal to `k`. The `' '.join()` method is then used to combine the words in the new list back into a single string, with spaces in between.</code></pre>

The `remove_length` function takes two arguments: `string` and `k`. The `string` argument is the input string, and `k` is the length of the words to be removed.

The function first splits the input string into a list of words using the `split` method. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of words that have a length different from `k`. Finally, it joins the words in the new list using the `join` method and returns the resulting string.

The `assert` statement at the end of the script tests the function with the given input and expected output. If the function returns the expected output, the assertion passes.</code></pre>

      <pre><code>  Here is the Python function to remove all the words with k length in the given string:

```python
def remove_length(s, k):
    words = s.split()
    return ' '.join(word for word in words if len(word) != k)

print(remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3))
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words. Then it uses a generator expression to create a new list that includes only the words that are not of length `k`. Finally, it joins the words back into a single string with spaces in between.

The `print` statement at the end is used to test the function with the provided example.

Explanation:

- We first split the string into a list of words using the `split()` method.
- We then iterate over each word in the list and check if its length is not equal to `k`.
- If the length of the word is not equal to `k`, we append it to the `result` list.
- Finally, we join the words in the `result` list using a space as the separator and return the resulting string. </code></pre>
