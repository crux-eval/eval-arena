We can use the `in` operator to check if a value exists in a sequence. If any value in `seq1` exists in `seq2`, the function returns `True`. If none of the values in `seq1` exist in `seq2`, it returns `False`.

We can test the function using the given example:

```python
assert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False
```

This will not raise an AssertionError because none of the values in `[1,2,3,4,5]` exist in `[6,7,8,9]`. </code></pre>

This Python script defines a function `overlapping` that takes two sequences as input arguments. The function iterates over each value in the first sequence and checks if it exists in the second sequence. If a value is found in the second sequence, the function returns `True`. If no values are found in the second sequence, the function returns `False`.

The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given input sequences and expected output. If the output of the function is not equal to the expected output, an `AssertionError` will be raised.
