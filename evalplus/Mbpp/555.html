      <pre><code>  Here's the Python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers:

```python
def difference(n):

    sum_of_numbers = sum(range(1, n+1))
    return sum_of_numbers**3 - sum_of_cubes
```

Explanation:

- We use list comprehension to generate a list of cubes of the first n natural numbers and then find the sum of the list using the `sum()` function.
- We also use the `range()` function to generate a list of the first n natural numbers and find the sum of the list using the `sum()` function.
- We return the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of numbers.

We can test the function using the `assert` statement as shown below:

```python
assert difference(3) == 30
```

This will raise an `AssertionError` if the function returns a value other than 30 for `n=3`. </code></pre>

      <p> mistral-large-latest. fail_base: False, fail_plus: False </p>
      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_of_cubes = sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n+1))
    sum_of_numbers = sum(i for i in range(1, n+1))
    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers

# Test the function
assert difference(3) == 30
```

In this function, `sum_of_cubes` is calculated by taking the sum of the cubes of all numbers in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). `sum_of_numbers` is calculated by taking the sum of all numbers in the same range. The function then returns the difference between `sum_of_cubes` and `sum_of_numbers`.</code></pre>

This function first calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using a list comprehension and the built-in `sum` function. It then calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers in a similar way. Finally, it returns the difference between these two sums.

The `assert` statement is used to test the function. If the function's output is not what is expected, an `AssertionError` will be raised. In this case, `difference(3)` should return `30`, so the `assert` statement should pass without raising an error.

The `assert` statement is used to test the function with an example input. The function should return `30` for `n=3`.</code></pre>

```python
def difference(n):

    sum_of_numbers = sum([i for i in range(1, n+1)])

This function first calculates the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers separately. It then returns the difference between these two sums. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the given example.

Explanation:
The `difference` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. 

The `sum_of_cubes` variable is calculated using a list comprehension that generates a list of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, and then the `sum` function is used to add up the values in the list. 

The `sum_of_numbers` variable is calculated using another list comprehension that generates a list of the first `n` natural numbers, and then the `sum` function is used to add up the values in the list. 

Finally, the function returns the difference between `sum_of_cubes` and `sum_of_numbers`. 

The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the input `n=3`, and the expected output is `30`.

      <pre><code>  Here's the Python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_of_cubes = sum([i**3 for i in range(1, n+1)])
    sum_of_numbers = sum(range(1, n+1))
    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. We use list comprehension to calculate the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The difference between the two is then returned. 

For example, `difference(3)` will return `30`, since the sum of cubes of the first three natural numbers is `1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 30`, and the sum of the first three natural numbers is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Therefore, the difference is `30 - 6 = 24`. </code></pre>
