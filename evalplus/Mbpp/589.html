It checks if the square of each number `i` in the range from 1 to `end` (inclusive) is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`. If so, it includes `i*i` in the list. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function returns the correct output for the given test case.</code></pre>

Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.
IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,172.16.254.1;
Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.
IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).

        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):
            if num % i == 0:

        else:
            squares.append(num)

```

The function first initializes an empty list called `squares`. It then loops through all numbers between `start` and `end` (inclusive) using a `for` loop. For each number, it checks if it is equal to 0, and if so, it skips to the next number.

If the number is not equal to 0, the function then loops through all numbers between 2 and the square root of the number (inclusive) using another `for` loop. For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by the current number. If it is, the function breaks out of the inner loop and moves on to the next number. If the number is not divisible by the current number, the function continues to the next number in the outer loop.

If the number is not divisible by any number between 2 and its square root, the function appends it to the `squares` list.

Finally, the function returns the `squares` list.

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement as follows:

```python
assert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

This asserts that the function returns `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` when called with `start=1` and `end=30`.</code></pre>

```python
def perfect_squares(start, end):
    result = []
    for i in range(start, end+1):
        if (i ** 0.5).is_integer():
            result.append(i)
    return result

print(perfect_squares(1,30))
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive). For each number, it checks if the square root of the number is an integer. If it is, the number is a perfect square and is added to the `result` list. The function finally returns this list.

When you run this code, it will print `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`, which are the perfect squares between 1 and 30.
