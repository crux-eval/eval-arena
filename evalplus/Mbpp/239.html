# Explanation:
# The function uses recursion to find the total number of sequences of length n. If n is 1, there is only one possible sequence, which is the number itself. If n is 2, there are m/2 possible sequences, since the second element can be any number between 1 and m/2. For n > 2, we can use the following logic:
# - We can start with any number between 1 and m/2 (inclusive).
# - For the second element, we can choose any number between 2*i and m, where i is the first element of the sequence.
# - For the third element, we can choose any number between 2*i and m, where i is the second element of the sequence.
# - And so on, until we reach the nth element.
# - We can use the same logic recursively to find the total number of sequences for each possible first element, and sum them up to get the total number of sequences.
# For example, for m=10 and n=4, we have:
# - For i=1, there are 5 possible sequences: (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
# - For i=2, there are 3 possible sequences: (2, 4, 8)
# - For i=3, there are 2 possible sequences: (3, 6)
# - For i=4, there is only one possible sequence: (4)
# - For i=5, there is no possible sequence.
# So the total number of sequences is 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11. </code></pre>

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):

    # Base case: for sequence of length 1, there are m possible sequences

assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4
```

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` that end with `j`. The outer loop iterates over the length of the sequence, the middle loop iterates over all possible ending numbers, and the inner loop iterates over all possible previous numbers that are less than half of the ending number. The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m^2).</code></pre>

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        dp[1][i] = 1

    return sum(dp[n])

# Test the function
assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4
```

This function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp[i][j]` represents the number of sequences of length `i` with the last element being `j`. For each `j`, we iterate through all `k` less than `j` and add the number of sequences of length `i-1` with the last element being `k` to `dp[i][j]`. Finally, we sum up all the `dp[n][j]` for `j` from 1 to `m` to get the total number of sequences of length `n`.

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):

        return m
    else:
        prev_seq = get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n-1)

        return curr_seq

assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4
```

The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` takes in two positive integers `m` and `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, then there is only one possible sequence of length 1, which is all elements from 1 to `m`. Otherwise, we can generate the sequence of length `n` by multiplying the sequence of length `n-1` by a sequence of length 1.

The sequence of length `n-1` is generated by calling the function recursively with `m` and `n-1` as arguments. The sequence of length 1 is simply `m`.

To generate the sequence of length `n`, we need to multiply the sequence of length `n-1` by a sequence of length 1. The sequence of length 1 is simply all elements from 1 to `m`. We can generate this sequence by iterating from 1 to `m` and adding each element to a list.

Once we have the sequence of length `n-1` and the sequence of length 1, we can multiply them together to get the sequence of length `n`. We can do this by iterating over the sequence of length `n-1` and multiplying each element by the corresponding element in the sequence of length 1. We can then sum up all the products to get the total number of possible sequences of length `n`.

The time complexity of this function is O(m^n), since we need to generate the sequence of length `n-1` recursively and then multiply it by the sequence of length 1. The space complexity is also O(m^n), since we need to store the sequence of length `n-1` and the sequence of length 1.</code></pre>

This function uses recursion to calculate the total number of sequences. It starts by checking if `n` is 0, in which case it returns 1 (since there is only one possible sequence of length 0, which is an empty sequence). If `n` is not 0, it initializes a variable `total` to 0 and then loops over all integers from `2 * n` to `m` (inclusive). For each integer `i`, it recursively calls `get_total_number_of_sequences(i, n - 1)` and adds the result to `total`. Finally, it returns `total`.

The function is then called with the arguments `10` and `4`, and the result is printed.

Explanation:
The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` takes in two positive integers `m` and `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, then there is only one possible sequence of length 1, which is a sequence of length 1 with any integer from 1 to `m`. If `n` is greater than 1, then we need to find the number of possible sequences of length `n-1` that can be appended to the end of any integer from 2 to `m`. We can recursively call the function with `n-1` and the current integer `i` as the new `m` until we reach the base case of `n` being equal to 1. Finally, we add up all the possible sequences of length `n-1` that can be appended to the end of any integer from 2 to `m` to get the total number of possible sequences of length `n`.

      <pre><code>  Here's a Python function that takes in positive integers m and n and returns the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m:

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return m // 2
    else:
        return (m - 1) * (m - 2) // 2
```

This function uses the formula for the number of possible sequences of length n, which is (m - 1) * (m - 2) // 2. The reason for this formula is that the first element can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and the second element can be any positive integer greater than or equal to twice the first element, and so on. Therefore, the number of possible sequences of length n is the product of (m - 1) and (m - 2) for n > 2. The function first checks if n is 1 or 2, in which case there is only one possible sequence, and returns 1 or (m - 1) respectively. Otherwise, it returns the product of (m - 1) and (m - 2) // 2. </code></pre>

This Python script defines a function `get_total_number_of_sequences` that takes in two positive integers `m` and `n`. The function returns the number of possible sequences of length `n`, where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to `m`.

The function uses recursion to calculate the number of possible sequences. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns `m`, since there is only one possible sequence of length 1 that satisfies the given conditions. Otherwise, the function returns the product of `m - 1` and the result of calling `get_total_number_of_sequences` with `m - 1` and `n - 1`. This is because each element in the sequence must be greater than or equal to twice the previous element, so the largest possible element in the sequence is `m - 1`.

The assert statement at the end of the script checks that the function returns the correct result for the given input values of `m` and `n`.
