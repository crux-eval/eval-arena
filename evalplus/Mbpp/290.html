      <pre><code>  Here's the Python code for the function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists:

```python
def max_length(lst):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for sublist in lst:
        if len(sublist) > max_len:
            max_len = len(sublist)
            max_list = sublist
    return max_len, max_list
```

The function takes a list of lists as input and initializes two variables `max_len` and `max_list`. It then iterates through each sublist in the input list and checks if its length is greater than the current `max_len`. If it is, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the length of the maximum sublist and the sublist itself.

We can test the function with the given example:

```python
assert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])
```

This should return `True` since the sublist `[13, 15, 17]` has the maximum length of 3 and is the longest sublist in the input list. </code></pre>

```python
def max_length(lst):
    max_len = 0
    max_lst = []
    for sub_lst in lst:
        if len(sub_lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(sub_lst)
            max_lst = sub_lst
    return max_len, max_lst
```

The function takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of any sublist and the sublist itself.

The function initializes two variables, `max_len` and `max_lst`, to 0 and an empty list, respectively. It then iterates over each sublist in the input list and checks if its length is greater than `max_len`. If it is, it updates `max_len` and `max_lst` to the new values.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_lst`.

The assertion in the problem checks that the function returns `(3, [13, 15, 17])` for the input list `[[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`.</code></pre>

This function works by iterating over each list in the input list of lists.
