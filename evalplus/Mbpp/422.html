Explanation:

- The function takes an integer `n` as input.
- It initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
- It uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n`.
- In each iteration, it adds the cube of the current number to the `sum` variable.
- After the loop, it divides the `sum` by `n` to get the average of cubes of first `n` natural numbers.
- Finally, it returns the average.

The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the correct output for the given input.</code></pre>

      <pre><code>  Here's the Python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers:

```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i**3
    return sum/n
```

Explanation:
- We initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
- We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n+1.
- For each iteration, we cube the current number and add it to the `sum` variable.
- Finally, we divide the `sum` by `n` and return the result.

Example:
```python
>>> find_Average_Of_Cube(2)
4.5
```

This function will return the average of cubes of first two natural numbers, which is 1^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9 and 9/2 = 4.5. </code></pre>
