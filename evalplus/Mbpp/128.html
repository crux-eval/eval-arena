Explanation:

The function `long_words` takes two arguments - `n` and `sentence`. `n` is the minimum length of the words that we want to find and `sentence` is the sentence from which we want to find the words that are longer than `n` characters. We first split the sentence into a list of words using the `split()` method. Then, we iterate through each word in the list and check if its length is greater than `n`. If it is, we append it to the `long_words` list. Finally, we return the `long_words` list. We use the `assert` statement to test the function with the given example and check if it returns the expected output. </code></pre>

      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that should solve the problem:

```python
def long_words(n, sentence):
    words = sentence.split()

    return long_words

# Test the function
assert long_words(3, "python is a programming language") == ['python', 'programming', 'language']
```

This function works by first splitting the input sentence into a list of words. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the words that are longer than `n` characters. The `len(word) > n` condition checks if a word is longer than `n` characters.</code></pre>

    for word in words:
        if len(word) > n:

```

The function takes two arguments: `n` and `words`. `n` is an integer representing the maximum length of the words to be returned, and `words` is a list of words.

The function initializes an empty list called `long_words`. It then loops through each word in the `words` list. If the length of the word is greater than `n`, it appends the word to the `long_words` list.

Finally, the function returns the `long_words` list.

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement. Here's an example:

```python
assert long_words(3, "python is a programming language") == ['python', 'programming', 'language']
```

This asserts that the function returns the expected output for the given input.</code></pre>

This function works by first splitting the input sentence into a list of words. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes words that are longer than `n` characters. The function finally returns this new list.

The test at the end of the code block calls the function with the provided test case and prints the result.

We split the sentence into a list of words using the `split()` method, and then loop through each word in the list. If the length of the word is greater than `n`, we append it to the `long_words` list. Finally, we return the `long_words` list. </code></pre>
