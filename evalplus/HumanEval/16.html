      <pre><code>  Sure, I can help with that. Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of

```

This function works by first converting the string to lowercase so that it can ignore case. It then creates a set from the string. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements, so this automatically removes any duplicate characters. Finally, it returns the length of the set, which is the number of unique characters.</code></pre>

    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    
    Args:

This function works by converting the input string to lowercase and then converting it to a set. A set in Python is a data structure that only contains unique elements, so this effectively removes any duplicate characters from the string. The function then returns the length of the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.

The function takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters in the string. It does this by first creating an empty set to store the distinct characters.

This function takes a string as input and converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` method. It then creates a set of distinct characters by calling the `set()` function on the lowercase string.

Explanation:

We first convert the string to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ignore case sensitivity. Then, we create an empty set called `unique_chars` to store unique characters. We iterate through each character in the string and add it to the set only if it's not already present. Finally, we return the length of the set, which gives us the number of distinct characters in the string. </code></pre>
