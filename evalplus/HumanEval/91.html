The function `is_bored` takes a string `S` as input and returns the number of boredoms in the string. It works by iterating over each character in the string and keeping track of the current sentence being processed. If a sentence delimiter is encountered ('.', '?' or '!'), the function checks if the sentence starts with the word "I" and increments the boredom count if it does. If a non-sentence delimiter is encountered, the function appends the character to the current sentence being processed. Finally, the function checks if the last sentence in the string starts with the word "I" and increments the boredom count if it does.

This Python script counts the number of boredoms in a given string of words. It splits the string into words, and for each word, it checks if it is "I". If it is, it increments the boredoms counter. Finally, it returns the boredoms counter.
