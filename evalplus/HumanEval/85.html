This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and only add the elements that are at odd indices and are even. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each element in the list. The `%` operator is used to get the remainder of the division of the index by 2, which is used to check if the index is odd. The `sum` function is used to add up all the elements that meet the conditions.

    Returns:

            total += lst[i]
    
    # Return the sum of even elements that are at odd indices
    return total
```

Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as input and initializes a variable `total` to 0. It then loops through the list using a for loop and checks if the current element is even using the modulo operator `%`. If the element is even, it adds it to the `total` variable. Finally, it returns the sum of even elements that are at odd indices. </code></pre>

def add(lst):

    return total
```

This code defines a function `add` that takes a non-empty list `lst` as input. It initializes a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of even elements at odd indices. Then, it iterates over the list using a for loop, starting from index 1 and incrementing by 2 in each iteration to only consider odd indices. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current index is even using the modulo operator `%`. If it is even, it adds it to the `total` variable. Finally, it returns the `total` variable as the result.</code></pre>
