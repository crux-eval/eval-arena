        result.append(num)

```

This function uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen. If we encounter a number we've seen before, we skip it. If we encounter a number for the first time, we add it to the set and to the result list. This way, we only add each number to the result list once, and we preserve the order of the numbers.</code></pre>

```

Explanation:

We define a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers. We create an empty list `unique_numbers` to store the unique elements of the input list. We then iterate through each element in the input list and check if it is already in the `unique_numbers` list. If it is not, we append it to the list. If it is already in the list, we skip it. Finally, we return the `unique_numbers` list. This will remove all duplicates from the input list while maintaining the order of the elements. </code></pre>

```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    for number in numbers:
        if numbers.count(number) == 1:
            unique_numbers.append(number)
    return unique_numbers
```

This code defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all elements that occur more than once removed. The order of the elements in the input list is preserved in the output list. The function uses a loop to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the count of that number in the list is equal to 1. If it is, the number is added to the `unique_numbers` list. Finally, the `unique_numbers` list is returned as the output.</code></pre>

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.

    Examples:
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    seen = set()
    result = []

        if num not in seen:
            seen.add(num)
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

This function works by maintaining a set of seen numbers. It iterates over the input list, and if it encounters a number that has not been seen before, it adds it to the result list and the set of seen numbers. The order of the elements in the result list is the same as in the input list, and all elements that occur more than once are removed.
