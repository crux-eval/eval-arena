def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]

def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3

      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve the problem. The function `minPath` takes a grid and an integer `k` as input and returns the minimum path of length `k` in the grid.

```python
from collections import deque

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    visited = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    min_path = deque([float('inf')] * k)

    def dfs(i, j, path):
        if len(path) == k:
            if path < min_path:
                min_path[:] = path
            return

        visited[i][j] = 1
        for dx, dy in directions:
            x, y = i + dx, j + dy
            if 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < n and not visited[x][y]:
                dfs(x, y, path + deque([grid[x][y]]))
        visited[i][j] = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            dfs(i, j, deque([grid[i][j]]))

    return list(min_path)
```

This function works by starting a DFS from each cell in the grid. It keeps track of the current path and the minimum path found so far. When the path length reaches `k`, it checks if the current path is lexicographically smaller than the minimum path. If it is, it updates the minimum path. The function returns the minimum path as a list.</code></pre>

      <pre><code>  This problem is a twist on the classic "shortest-path" problem with a couple of additional conditions. Not only must the path be of minimal length, but all the values in the path must be unique (no repeats).

To solve the problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible paths of length k, and then return the one with the smallest sum of values.

First, we can flatten the grid into a list and sort it in ascending order. This will help us to easily identify values that are in the same position in two different paths.

Next, we can use a set to keep track of all visited values as we search the grid. This will help us to avoid visiting the same cell twice.

Finally, we can use a recursive function to find all possible paths of length k starting from each cell. We can keep track of the current path and its sum of values, and if it is currently the smallest, we can update our answer.

Here is the Python code for the above approach:

The script uses dynamic programming to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. It uses a 3D array dp to store the minimum cost of reaching the cell (i, j) with a path of length l. The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 0, since we can start from any cell and have a path of length 0.

For each cell (i, j), we can either move to its left cell (i, j-1) or its upper cell (i-1, j) or its diagonal cell (i-1, j-1). We choose the move that results in the minimum cost. We also need to consider the case where we don't move at all, in which case dp[l][i][j] = dp[l-1][i-1][j-1].

After filling the dp array, we can backtrack to find the minimum path. We start from the bottom right cell (n-1, n-1) and move to the cell with the minimum cost, taking into account the constraints of not going off the grid and not visiting the same cell twice. We keep track of the values on the cells that the path goes through and return them in reverse order.</code></pre>

This function uses dynamic programming to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. It first initializes the `dp` and `path` arrays. Then, for each length from 2 to k, it iterates over all cells in the grid and for each cell, it iterates over all its neighbors. If the current cell's value plus the minimum path to the neighbor cell is less than the current minimum path to the current cell, it updates the minimum path and the path. Finally, it returns the minimum path of length k.

Explanation:
The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. It starts by marking the current cell as visited and recursively explores all its neighboring cells. If the path length reaches k, it compares the path value with the current minimum path value and updates it if necessary. After exploring all possible paths, it returns the minimum path of length k.

This Python script defines a function `minPath` that takes a grid and a positive integer `k` as input. The function uses depth-first search (DFS) to find the minimum path of length `k` in the grid. The DFS function `dfs` is defined recursively to explore the grid and backtrack when the path length reaches `k`. The function returns the minimum path as a list of values on the cells that the path goes through.

def minPath(grid, k):

    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

```

The function `minPath` takes two parameters: a 2D array `grid` representing the grid of values and an integer `k` representing the length of the path. The function should return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path goes through.

Your task is to implement the function `minPath` to find the minimum path of length `k` in the grid. You can start from any cell and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells (cells that share an edge with your current cell). Please note that a path of length `k` means visiting exactly `k` cells (not necessarily distinct). You cannot go off the grid.

A path `A` (of length `k`) is considered less than a path `B` (of length `k`) if after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that `A` and `B` go through (let's call them `lst_A` and `lst_B`), `lst_A` is lexicographically less than `lst_B`, i.e., there exists an integer index `i` (1 <= `i` <= `k`) such that `lst_A[i] < lst_B[i]` and for any `j` (1 <= `j` < `i`) we have `lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]`.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

You should return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path goes through.

Note: You can assume that the input grid is always valid and the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 3
Output: [1,2,1]
Explanation: The minimum path of length 3 is [1,2,1].

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[5,9,3],[4,1,6],[7,8,2]], k = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The minimum path of length 1 is [1].

Constraints:

- `N` is the length of the grid.
- `N` is in the range [2, 10</code></pre>
