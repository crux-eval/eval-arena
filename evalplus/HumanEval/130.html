This code defines a function `tri` that takes an integer `n` as input. It initializes a list `sequence` with the first two numbers of the Tribonacci sequence (1 and 3). Then, it uses a for loop to generate the next `n - 1` numbers of the sequence. If the current number `i` is even, it appends `1 + i / 2` to the sequence. If `i` is odd, it appends the sum of the last three numbers in the sequence to the sequence. Finally, it returns the sequence.</code></pre>

The function `tri` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1 or 2, in which case it returns the appropriate list. For `n` greater than 2, the function initializes a list `tri_list` with the first two numbers of the sequence, and then iterates over the remaining numbers of the sequence using a `for` loop. For even numbers of `i`, the function appends `1 + i // 2` to `tri_list`. For odd numbers of `i`, the function appends the sum of the previous three numbers of the sequence to `tri_list`. Finally, the function appends the sum of the last three numbers of the sequence to `tri_list` to complete the sequence. The function returns the completed `tri_list`.</code></pre>

This function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, and returns the corresponding initial Tribonacci sequence. If `n` is greater than 1, it initializes the Tribonacci sequence with the first three numbers. Then, it iterates from 3 to `n`, and for each number, it checks if it is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the next number in the sequence as `1 + i / 2`. If it is odd, it calculates the next number in the sequence as the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence. Finally, it returns the complete Tribonacci sequence.

Explanation:
The function `tri` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n+1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` if `n` is even, and `tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)` if `n` is odd.

The function first checks if `n` is 0, 1, or 2, and returns the corresponding list of the first `n+1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. If `n` is greater than 2, the function initializes a list `sequence` with the first three numbers of the sequence (1, 3, 2). It then iterates over the range from 3 to `n+1`, and for each `i`, it checks if `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it appends `1 + i // 2` to the list. If `i` is odd, it appends the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence to the list. Finally, the function returns the `sequence` list.
