def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

def compare(game, guess):
    """
    I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited

    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.

        else:
            result.append(abs(game[i] - guess[i]))
    return result
```

Here's how the function works:

- The function takes two arrays as input: `game` and `guess`.
- It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the comparison results.
- It loops through each index of the `game` and `guess` arrays using the `range()` function.
- If the value at the current index of `game` is equal to the value at the current index of `guess`, it means the player guessed correctly, so the result is 0.
- If the value at the current index of `game` is not equal to the value at the current index of `guess`, it means the player guessed incorrectly, so the result is the absolute difference between the two values.
- The result is appended to the `result` list.
- Finally, the function returns the `result` list.

Here are some examples of how to use the function:

```python
>>> compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])
[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]

>>> compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])
[4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]
```

In the first example, the player correctly guessed the first four matches, but the fifth match was off by 3, and the sixth match was off by 3. In the second example, the player correctly guessed the first three matches, but the fourth match was off by 1, and the fifth match was off by 6.</code></pre>

This code defines a function `compare` that takes two arrays `game` and `guess` as input. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the differences between the guesses and the actual scores.

Then, it iterates over the indices of the arrays using a for loop. For each index, it checks if the guess is equal to the score. If they are equal, it appends 0 to the `result` list. Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference between the guess and the score using the `abs` function and appends it to the `result` list.

Finally, it returns the `result` list, which contains the differences between the guesses and the actual scores for each match.</code></pre>
