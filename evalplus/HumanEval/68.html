def pluck(arr):
    """
    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value

```

The function `pluck` takes an array `arr` as input and returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, it returns an empty list.

The function first creates an empty list `even_values` to store the even values and their indices. It then loops through the array and checks if each element is even. If it is, it appends a list containing the element and its index to `even_values`.

After the loop, the function checks if `even_values` is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list.

If `even_values` is not empty, the function finds the smallest even value by using the `min` function with the `key` parameter set to `lambda x: x[0]`. This returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index.

Finally, the function returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index.</code></pre>

Explanation:
The function `pluck` takes an array `arr` as input and returns a list containing the smallest even node and its index.

First, we create a new list `even_nodes` by iterating over the elements of `arr` and checking if each element is even. If an element is even, we add it to `even_nodes`.

Next, we check if `even_nodes` is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.

If `even_nodes` is not empty, we find the smallest even node by using the `min` function. We then find the index of the smallest even node in `arr` using the `index` method.

Finally, we return a list containing the smallest even node and its index.

This Python script defines a function `pluck` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index. If there are no even values or the array is empty, it returns an empty list.

The function first creates a list of tuples `even_values` that contains the even values and their indices. It then sorts this list in ascending order of values. If the list is empty, it means there are no even values, so it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the first tuple in the list, which contains the smallest even value and its index.
