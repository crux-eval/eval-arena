def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)

If there are not enough remaining carrots, it returns the total number of carrots eaten plus the remaining carrots.

def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total_eaten = number + min(need, remaining)
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```

This code calculates the total number of eaten carrots by adding the initial number of carrots eaten (`number`) with the minimum of the number of carrots needed (`need`) and the number of remaining carrots (`remaining`). It also calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the number of carrots needed from the remaining carrots, but ensuring the result is not negative.

This function first calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten to the number of carrots needed to be eaten. If there are enough remaining carrots to satisfy the need, it subtracts the need from the remaining and adds the need to the total eaten. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it adds the remaining to the total eaten and sets the remaining to 0.

```

This Python script defines a function `eat` that takes three integer arguments: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. The function calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the current number of eaten carrots (`number`) to the minimum of the remaining carrots (`remaining`) and the number of carrots needed to complete the day's meals (`need`). The function then calculates the remaining carrots after the meals by subtracting the difference between the needed carrots and the total eaten carrots from the remaining carrots. Finally, the function returns a list containing the total number of eaten carrots and the remaining carrots after the meals.
