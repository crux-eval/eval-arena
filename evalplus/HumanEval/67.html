      <pre><code>  Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    This function calculates the number of mango fruits in a basket given the total number of fruits and a string that represents the number of apples and oranges.
    """
    # Extract the numbers of apples and oranges from the string
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' apples and ')[0], s.split(' oranges')[0])

    # Calculate the number of mango fruits
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges

    return mangoes
```

This function works by first using the `split` method to separate the string into parts and extract the numbers of apples and oranges. It then subtracts these numbers from the total number of fruits to find the number of mango fruits.

Please note that there's a small error in your original string splitting logic. The corrected version should be:

```python
apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' apples and ')), map(int, s.split(' oranges')[0].split())
```

This is because the `split` method returns a list, and we need to convert the elements of this list to integers using `map`. Also, the string needs to be split correctly to isolate the numbers of apples and oranges.</code></pre>

We do the same for the second part and store it in the variable `oranges`. We calculate the total number of fruits in the basket by adding the values of `apples` and `oranges`. Finally, we subtract the total number of fruits from the given integer `n` to get the number of mango fruits in the basket and return it. </code></pre>

print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3))
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100))
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120))
```

This script defines a function `fruit_distribution` that takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as input. The string `s` represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and the integer `n` represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method. It then extracts the number of apples and oranges from the first and second words of the list, respectively, using the `split()` method again to separate the number from the word "apples" or "oranges".

The function then calculates the number of mangos in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits `n`.

Finally, the function returns the number of mangos in the basket.

The script then calls the `fruit_distribution` function with different inputs and prints the output.
