def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Create a frequency array to count occurrences of each element

    for i in range(n):

    # Initialize left and right pointers

    right = n - 1

    # Initialize count to keep track of the number of changes
    count = 0

    # Traverse the array from both ends
    while left < right:
        # If the current elements are not equal
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            # Find the closest element to arr[right] that has a frequency greater than 0
            # This can be done by decreasing the value of arr[right] until we find a value with a non-zero frequency
            while freq[arr[right]] == 0:
                arr[right] -= 1

            # Increase the count and decrease the frequency of the chosen element
            count += 1
            freq[arr[right]] -= 1

            # If the frequency of the current element at arr[right] becomes 0,
            # we need to increase its frequency by 1 to ensure that we can use it again in the future
            if freq[arr[right]] == 0:
                freq[arr[right]] += 1
        else:
            # If the current elements are equal, we just move the pointers
            left += 1
            right -= 1

    return count
```

This function works by first creating a frequency array to count the occurrences of each element in the array. Then, it traverses the array from both ends, and if it finds two elements that are not equal, it changes the right element to the closest element that has a frequency greater than 0. The number of changes is then returned.</code></pre>

```

The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. The function first initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of changes required. It then loops through all pairs of elements in the array using two nested loops. For each pair, it checks if the two elements are different. If they are different, it increments the `count` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the `count` variable, which represents the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are looping through all pairs of elements in the array. The space complexity of the function is O(1), because we are only using a constant amount of extra space to store the `count` variable.</code></pre>

This function uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the array. The length of the longest palindromic subsequence is the length of the longest common subsequence of the array and its reverse. The minimum number of changes to make the array palindromic is then the difference between the length of the array and the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the use of a 2D dynamic programming table.

Explanation:
The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

The function first calculates the length of the array `n` and initializes a variable `changes` to 0.

It then iterates through the first half of the array using a for loop, comparing each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. If the elements are not equal, it increments the `changes` variable.

Finally, the function returns the value of `changes`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

```

This function works by comparing the elements at the start and end of the array, and incrementing the change count if they are not equal. It then moves the left and right pointers towards the center of the array, repeating this process until the left and right pointers meet in the middle.

This Python script defines a function `smallest_change` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. The function iterates through the first half of the array and compares each element with its corresponding element in the second half. If the elements are not equal, the function increments a counter. The function then returns the counter value.
