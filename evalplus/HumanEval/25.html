      <pre><code>  Sure, I'd be happy to help you write a Python function to factorize a number into its prime factors. Here's a simple way to do it:

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    return factors
```

This function works by iterating over all numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive). For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If it is, it appends `i` to the list of factors and updates `n` to be `n // i`. It continues this process until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`, at which point it moves on to the next number. This ensures that each factor is included in the list as many times as it appears in the factorization of `n`.</code></pre>

    if n > 1:

```

The `factorize` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n` in the order from smallest to largest. Each of the factors is listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in the factorization. The input number should be equal to the product of all factors.

The function first initializes an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors of `n`. It then sets `i` to 2 and iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means that `i` is a prime factor of `n`. In this case, the function divides `n` by `i` and appends `i` to the `factors` list. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it means that `i` is not a prime factor of `n`. In this case, the function increments `i` by 1 and continues the loop.

After the loop, if `n` is greater than 1, it means that `n` itself is a prime factor of `n`. In this case, the function appends `n` to the `factors` list. Finally, the function returns the `factors` list.</code></pre>

            factors.append(i)

```

This function works by continuously dividing the input number by increasing integers starting from 2 until the square of the current integer is greater than the input number. If the input number is divisible by the current integer, it is divided and the integer is added to the list of factors. If the input number is not divisible by the current integer, the current integer is incremented. The process continues until the square of the current integer is greater than the input number. If the input number is greater than 1 after this process, it is added to the list of factors. The function then returns the list of factors.

Explanation:

We start by initializing an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors of the given integer `n`. We then iterate through all the numbers from 2 to `n` and check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, we count the number of times `i` divides `n` and append `i` to the `factors` list. We keep doing this until `n` becomes 1. Finally, we return the `factors` list. </code></pre>

This function works by dividing the input number by the divisor starting from 2, and if the number is divisible, it appends the divisor to the list of factors and divides the number by the divisor. The divisor is incremented by 1 in each iteration. This process continues until the number is no longer divisible by the divisor, at which point the divisor is incremented and the process starts again.

This Python script uses the factorization method to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by the current number. If it is, the number is divided by the current number and the current number is added to the list of factors. If the number is not divisible by the current number, the current number is incremented by 1. If the number is greater than 1 after the loop, it means that the number is a prime factor and it is added to the list of factors. The function returns the list of factors in the order from smallest to largest.
