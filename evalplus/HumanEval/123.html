Explanation:
The function `get_odd_collatz` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence is generated by starting with `n` and repeatedly applying the rules defined in the problem statement until `n` becomes 1. The odd numbers in the sequence are then extracted and sorted before being returned.

The function first initializes a list `collatz_sequence` with the initial value of `n`. It then enters a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it is divided by 2 and the result is stored in `n`. If `n` is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to it, and the result is stored in `n`. The current value of `n` is then appended to `collatz_sequence`.

After the loop terminates, the function uses a list comprehension to extract all odd numbers from `collatz_sequence`. The resulting list is then sorted in increasing order using the `sorted` function and returned as the final output.

Explanation:

The function `get_odd_collatz` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. If `n` is 1, it returns `[1]` as the Collatz sequence for 1 is `[1]`. Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `odd_numbers` to store the odd numbers in the sequence. It then enters a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1. In each iteration, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it appends `n` to `odd_numbers` and updates `n` to `3 * n + 1`. If `n` is even, it updates `n` to `n // 2`. The loop continues until `n` becomes 1. Finally, it returns the sorted `odd_numbers` list. </code></pre>

This Python script defines a function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for `n`. The function uses a helper function `collatz(n)` to generate the Collatz sequence for a given number `n`. The `collatz(n)` function is a recursive function that follows the rules of the Collatz conjecture. The `get_odd_collatz(n)` function then converts the list of numbers generated by `collatz(n)` to a set to remove duplicates, and finally sorts the set in increasing order.
