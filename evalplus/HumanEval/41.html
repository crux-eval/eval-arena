      <pre><code>  Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. Given that all cars are moving at the same speed and they continue moving in their trajectory after a collision, we can assume that every car moving left to right will collide with every car moving right to left. Therefore, the number of collisions is simply the product of the number of cars in each set. Here's how you could write the function:

```python

      <pre><code>  Here's a possible implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize the cars' positions
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    collisions = 0
    
    # Move the cars until they collide
    while left_cars and right_cars:
        # Move the left cars
        for i in range(n):
            if left_cars[i] < n - 1:
                left_cars[i] += 1
            else:
                left_cars[i] = 0
        
        # Move the right cars
        for i in range(n):
            if right_cars[i] > 0:
                right_cars[i] -= 1
            else:
                right_cars[i] = n - 1
        
        # Check for collisions
        for i in range(n):
            if left_cars[i] == right_cars[i]:
                collisions += 1
    
    return collisions
```

The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars on the road. It initializes two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, with the positions of the cars on the left and right sides of the road, respectively. It also initializes a counter `collisions` to keep track of the number of collisions.

The function then enters a loop that continues until there are no more cars on either side of the road. In each iteration of the loop, the function moves the cars on the left side of the road by incrementing their positions by 1, and the cars on the right side of the road by decrementing their positions by 1. If a car reaches the end of the road, it wraps around to the beginning.

After moving the cars, the function checks for collisions by comparing the positions of the cars on the left and right sides. If two cars have the same position, it means they collided and the function increments the `collisions` counter.

Finally, the function returns the value of `collisions`, which represents the number of collisions that occurred during the race.</code></pre>
