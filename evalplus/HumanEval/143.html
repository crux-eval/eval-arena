    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"

      <pre><code>  Sure, here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
import sympy

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    words = sentence.split(' ')
    prime_words = []
    for word in words:
        if sympy.isprime(len(word)):
            prime_words.append(word)
    return ' '.join(prime_words)
```

This function works by splitting the sentence into words, then checking if the length of each word is a prime number. If it is, the word is added to the `prime_words` list. Finally, the words in the `prime_words` list are joined together into a string, with a space between each word.

The `sympy.isprime` function is used to check if a number is prime. This function is part of the `sympy` library, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. If you don't have this library installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy

This function first defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. It then splits the input sentence into words, and for each word, if its length is a prime number, it adds it to the result list. Finally, it joins the words in the result list into a string with spaces in between and returns it.

Explanation:
The `is_prime` function checks whether a given number is prime or not. It returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

The `words_in_sentence` function takes a sentence as input, splits it into words using the `split` method, and then filters out the words whose lengths are not prime using a list comprehension. The filtered words are then joined back into a string using the `join` method and returned.

Finally, it joins the words back into a sentence with spaces in between, and returns the result.

This Python script defines a function `words_in_sentence` that takes a sentence as input, splits it into words, and then checks if the length of each word is a prime number. If it is, the word is added to the result string. The function `is_prime` is used to check if a number is prime or not. The `strip` function is used to remove the trailing space from the result string.
